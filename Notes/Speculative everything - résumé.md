#Speculative everything

###Beyond Radical Design

pour la plupart des gens, design  = résoudre des problèmes
design anglo-saxon, encore assez voué au commerce

> Rather than giving up altogether, though, there are **other possibilities** for design: one is to use design as a means of speculating how things could be — **speculative design**.

> Design speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship to reality.

> [...] ; when it comes to technology, future predictions have been proven wrong again and again. In our view, it is a pointless activity. What we are interested in, though, is the idea of possible futures and using them as tools to better understand the present and to discuss the kind of future people want, and, of course, ones people do not want.

> They usually take the form of scenarios, often starting with a what-if question, and are intended to open up spaces of debate and discussion; therefore, they are by necessity provocative, intentionally simplified, and fictional.

> We have long been inspired by radical architecture and fine art that use speculation for critical and provocative purposes, particularly projects from the 1960s and 1970s by studios such as Archigram, Archizoom, Superstudio, Ant Farm, Haus-Rucker-Co, and Walter Pichler.

> Triggered by the financial crash of 2008, there has been a new wave of interest in thinking about alternatives to the current system. [...] But to do this, we need more pluralism in design, not of style but of ideology and values.

> It has a short but rich history and it is a place where many interconnected and not very well understood forms of design happen—speculative design, critical design,design fiction, design futures, antidesign, radical design, interrogative design, design for debate, adversarial design, discursive design, futurescaping, and some design art.

> It is different from social and humanitarian design, and design thinking too, which, although also often rejecting market-driven design, still operate within the limits of reality as it is. This is very important for us. We are not talking about a space for experimenting with how things are now, making them better or different, but about other possibilities altogether.

> We are more interested in designing for how things could be. Conceptual design provides a space for doing this. It deals, by definition, with unreality. Conceptual designs are not conceptual because they haven’t yet been realized or are waiting to be realized but out of choice. They celebrate their unreality and take full advantage of being made from ideas.

> It is often said that if something is conceptual, it is only an idea, but that is missing the point. It is because it is an idea that it is important. New ideas are exactly what we need today. 

> one of the main purposes of conceptual design, therefore, as we see it, is to provide an alternative context to design that is driven entirely by market forces. It is a space for thinking, for trying out ideas, and ideals.

> The concept and idea are different. The former implies a general direction while the latter is the component. Ideas implement the concept.
(un peu à la manière d'une classe et d'un objet en code !)

> Today, although furniture is still where most conceptual activity happens, the focus is on aesthetics, manufacturing processes, and materials.

> Similar to many people in the field of interactive devices his work sits between design and art. The devices often look industrially produced but are usually one-offs for galleries.

> The technology industry does have its own tradition of conceptual design in the form of Vision of the Future video scenarios setting out future directions or promoting new corporate values but they are often very limited in their scope and vision. They usually feature perfect worlds for perfect people interacting perfectly with perfect technologies.

> Since Syd Mead and Luigi Colani, there haven’t really been many, if any, designers who have concentrated on developing highly speculative scenarios either independently or with companies. There have been occasional surrealistic moments from designers such as Marc Newson, Jaime Hayón, and Marcel Wanders, which although mainly marketing oriented, broke away from furniture to explore their imaginative inner worlds and fantastical design objects.

> These extravagantly absurd technological fantasy objects hinted at a future direction for design cut short by the global financial crash. Although decadent and often marketing exercises,for a moment, designers broke away from narrow cultural references and the limited imagination of most design shows.
